# Future Work

To further enhance this project and demonstrate advanced analytics skills, consider:

- Incorporate time-series forecasting for schedule and budget trends.
- Implement project risk scoring using machine learning to predict project failures.
- Build interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash or Streamlit for stakeholder reporting.
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., resource allocation, cost breakdowns) to broaden insights.
- Experiment with advanced algorithms (e.g., gradient boosting, XGBoost) and hyperparameter tuning.
